Contributing

Setup
- Create a venv, install dev deps: `pip install -e '.[dev]'`
- Install pre-commit: `pre-commit install`

Workflow
- Branch from main, open a PR with a clear description and checklist.
- Include tests for pure functions (slicer, parsers, mappers).
- Keep scraping polite by default in examples and docs.
