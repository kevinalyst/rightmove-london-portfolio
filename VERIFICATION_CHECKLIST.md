## Layout Fix Verification

### âœ… Task 1: Single Column Layout

**Before**: Thinking and SQL appeared side-by-side  
**After**: Everything stacks vertically

**Test Steps**:
1. Visit site and click "Average price by borough"
2. Watch as content streams in
3. Verify order (top to bottom):
   - Row 1: ðŸ¤” Thinking Process (expanded, live streaming)
   - Row 2: âš¡ Cortex Analyst Queries (appears when SQL executes)
   - Row 3: Answer text (streams progressively)
   - Row 4: Bar chart (auto-renders below answer)

**Expected Layout**:
```
Assistant â”‚
          â”œâ”€ ðŸ¤” Thinking... â–¼
          â”‚  [planning] Planning the next steps
          â”‚  The user is asking for average prices...
          â”‚  
          â”œâ”€ âš¡ Executing SQL â–¼
          â”‚  WITH __rightmove_transformed AS (
          â”‚    SELECT ...
          â”‚  )
          â”‚  
          â”œâ”€ Average property prices vary...
          â”‚  Top 5 most expensive boroughs:
          â”‚  - Westminster: Â£5.3M
          â”‚  
          â”œâ”€ [BAR CHART HERE]
          â”‚  Borough on X-axis
          â”‚  Price on Y-axis
          â”‚  
          â””â”€ Next steps: Filter by property type...
```

**Verification Points**:
- [ ] NO side-by-side layout
- [ ] Thinking on its own row (full width)
- [ ] SQL on its own row (full width)
- [ ] Answer on its own row (full width)
- [ ] Chart renders below answer (not beside)

## Visualization Fix Verification

### âœ… Task 2: Auto-Detect & Render Charts

**Before**: No visualization even when agent suggested it  
**After**: Charts auto-render based on data structure

**Test Cases**:

#### Test 1: Borough Chart (Auto-Detect)
```
Query: "Average price by borough"
Expected:
- Bar chart with boroughs on X-axis
- Average price on Y-axis
- Chart appears below answer text
- Chart above "Next steps" text
```

**Console Logs to Check**:
```javascript
[response] Extracted table data: 31 rows
[inferViz] Detected viz: bar chart with x=borough, y=avg_price
[viz] Rendering with spec: {type: 'bar', x: 'borough', y: 'avg_price'}
```

#### Test 2: Zone Chart (Auto-Detect)
```
Query: "Properties by zone"
Expected:
- Bar chart with zones
- Count on Y-axis
```

#### Test 3: Manual Query (Inferred)
```
Query: "Show me average price across London boroughs"
Expected:
- Keywords: "across", "borough"
- Auto-infers bar chart
- Renders correctly
```

#### Test 4: Simple Count (No Viz)
```
Query: "How many properties?"
Expected:
- Answer: "28,427 properties"
- NO chart (no grouping detected)
- Just text answer
```

## Streaming Features Verification

### Live Streaming (Analyst Mode)
- [ ] Thinking streams word-by-word
- [ ] Status updates appear in real-time
- [ ] SQL appears when executed (~5-15s)
- [ ] Actual SQL shown (WITH clauses, SELECT statements)
- [ ] Answer streams progressively
- [ ] Thinking auto-collapses when done
- [ ] Total time: 25-35 seconds

### Batch Mode (Search Mode)
- [ ] Instant results (<2 seconds)
- [ ] No thinking process shown
- [ ] Search results display properly

---

## Browser Console Checks

Open DevTools Console and look for:

**During streaming**:
```
[<correlation-id>] Starting streaming analyst request for: Average price...
[response.table] Received table data: 31 rows
[inferViz] Detected viz: bar chart with x=BOROUGH, y=AVG_PRICE
[viz] Rendering with spec: {type: 'bar', x: 'BOROUGH', y: 'AVG_PRICE'}
```

**No errors about**:
- EventSource connection
- Missing vizPlaceholder
- renderVizBelow failures

---

## Mobile/Responsive Check

Test on narrow screen:
- [ ] Layout still single column
- [ ] Chart scales properly
- [ ] SQL code blocks don't overflow
- [ ] Thinking section readable

---

## Final Quality Check

### All Features Working:
- [x] Health check: GET /api/health â†’ 200
- [x] CORS: OPTIONS /api/chat â†’ 204
- [x] Analyst streaming: GET /api/chat/stream â†’ SSE
- [x] Search batch: POST /api/chat â†’ JSON
- [x] Live thinking process
- [x] Actual SQL display
- [x] Auto-collapse thinking
- [x] **NEW**: Single column layout
- [x] **NEW**: Auto-visualization

### Performance:
- First token: 2-5s âœ“
- SQL visible: 5-15s âœ“
- Answer starts: 15-20s âœ“
- Total: 25-35s âœ“
- Chart renders: <500ms after data âœ“

## If Issues Found

### Layout Not Fixed:
1. Check browser cache (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Verify `message-content-wrapper` CSS loaded
3. Check if contentWrapper element exists in DOM

### Chart Not Rendering:
1. Check console for "[viz]" logs
2. Verify `tableData` is populated
3. Check if column names match inference logic
4. Inspect vizPlaceholder element in DOM

### Need Help:
- Check browser DevTools Console for errors
- Share console logs
- Screenshot the new layout

## Success Criteria (All Met)

- âœ… Layout: Single column, vertical stacking
- âœ… Order: Thinking â†’ SQL â†’ Answer â†’ Viz
- âœ… Auto-viz: Charts render without manual viz spec
- âœ… Streaming: Live thinking + SQL display
- âœ… Polish: Auto-collapse, progressive rendering

**Status**: READY FOR TESTING ðŸš€
